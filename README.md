# VLBIana

This repository combines a selection of analysing tools for VLBI data, written in Python.

The script align_imagesEHTim.py requires the eht-imageing module, which can be obtained from
https://github.com/achael/eht-imaging.git

The script plotSet.py for setting the figure dimensions is taken from https://jwalton.info/Embed-Publication-Matplotlib-Latex/
